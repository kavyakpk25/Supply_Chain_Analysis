Data Analytics Final Project - Semester 5

This project requires the installation of the following libraries - 
1) pandas
2) numpy
3) matplotlib

5) statsmodels

The cleaned dataset is present at Dataset/Cleaned_data.csv. Code used for this is present at 'Data Cleaning and PreProcessing- For Time Series Analysis.ipynb'.

After installation, clone the repo:
1) run Random Forest Approach.ipynb to view results obtained for the random forest regressor
2) run Univariate Forecast.ipynb to view results of the univariate time series model
3) run Multivariate Analysis.ipynb to view results of multivariate time series model
